Hi there, I'm Chris. 

I am currently a senior scientist at Deep Genomics in Toronto. My work involves using machine learning and AI to identify causal drug targets from human genetics data. I previously completed my DPhil working with Gerton Lunter and Thomas Milne at the University of Oxford. Check out my [website](http://chrisbcole.me/) for a breakdown of previous projects and repositories of interest.

### Hi there, I'm Chris.

I am a research scientist at Deep Genomics in Toronto. Iâ€™m interested in studying functional genomics using machine learning, as well as learning about ancient history from DNA. Check out my [website](http://chrisbcole.me/) for more information.



I work mainly in R, python, and C++, though I have hobbiest interests in many other languages including MATLAB, Julia and Rust. Outside of work, I am an avid hiker, coffee enthusiast, and home baker (though the last is a work in progress).

Iâ€™m a student in the [DPhil Genomic Medicine and Statistics](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/dphil-genomic-medicine-and-statistics?wssl=1) program at the [University of Oxford](https://ox.ac.uk), jointly funded by the [Wellcome Trust](https://wellcome.org/) and the [Clarendon Fund](http://www.ox.ac.uk/clarendon/about). I work at the [Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics](https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/) and [Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine (WIMM)](imm.ox.ac.uk) with my supervisors [Gerton Lunter](https://www.imm.ox.ac.uk/people/gerton-lunter), [Thomas Milne](https://www.rdm.ox.ac.uk/people/thomas-milne), and [Jim Hughes](https://www.imm.ox.ac.uk/research/units-and-centres/mrc-wimm-centre-for-computational-biology/groups/hughes-group). I graduated with an [Honours BSc in Biomedical Science](https://catalogue.uottawa.ca/en/undergrad/honours-bsc-biomedical-science/) specializing in Biostatistics from the [University of Ottawa](https://www.uottawa.ca/en) in 2017.
