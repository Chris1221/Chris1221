### Hi there, I'm Chris.

Iâ€™m interested in studying functional genomics using machine learning, as well as learning about ancient history from DNA. Check out my [website](http://chrisbcole.me/) for more information.

Iâ€™m a student in the DPhil Genomic Medicine and Statistics program at the University of Oxford, jointly funded by the Wellcome Trust and the Clarendon Fund. I work at the Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics and Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine (WIMM) with my supervisors Gerton Lunter, Thomas Milne, and Jim Hughes. I graduated with an Honours BSc in Biomedical Science specializing in Biostatistics from the University of Ottawa in 2017.

Outside of work, I am an avid hiker, coffee enthusiast, and home baker (though the last is a work in progress).
